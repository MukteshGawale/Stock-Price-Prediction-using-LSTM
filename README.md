# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical closing prices. It preprocesses data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), trains an LSTM model, and visualizes the predicted vs actual stock prices.
